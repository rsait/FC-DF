# Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function (FC-DF)

 This repository contains the R code to apply the Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function (FC-DF) algorithm. Besides, examples to ease the application of FC-DF are included:
 - example1.R contains a simple application of the FC-DF with given hyper-parameters values.
 - example2.R extends the first example including the search for suitable hyper-parameter values.
 
  In addition, public data sets used in the work  *Fuzzy classification with distance-based depth prototypes: High-dimensional Unsupervised and/or Supervised problems*, as well as the R files (AlizadehReproducibility.R, ClevelandReproducibility.R) including the performed analysis are included. A docker container is provided, and isntructions for its downloading and execution are given in a subsequent section.

The source of the public data set are:
 - A. A. Alizadeh, M. B. Eisen, R. E. Davis, et al., Distinct types of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling, *Nature*, (2000), 403, 503â€“511
 - D. Dua, C. Graff, UCI machine learning repository (2017). URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml
 
## Running the examples
 
 You might need to install the libraries *dplyr*, *fclust*, *mnormt*, *ICGE*, *splitTools* if not already present in your R installation.
