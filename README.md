# Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function (FC-DF)

 This repository contains the R code to apply the Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function (FC-DF) algorithm. Besides, examples to ease the application of FC-DF are included:
 - example1.R contains a simple application of the FC-DF with given hyper-parameters values.
 - example2.R extends the first example including the search for suitable hyper-parameter values.
 
  In addition, public data sets used in the work  *Fuzzy classification with distance-based depth prototypes: High-dimensional Unsupervised and/or Supervised problems*, as well as the R files (AlizadehReproducibility.R, ClevelandReproducibility.R) including the performed analysis are included. A docker container is provided, and instructions for downloading and running it are given in a subsequent section.

The source of the public data set are:
 - A. A. Alizadeh, M. B. Eisen, R. E. Davis, et al., Distinct types of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling, *Nature*, (2000), 403, 503â€“511
 - D. Dua, C. Graff, UCI machine learning repository (2017). URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml
 
## Running the examples
 
 You might need to install the libraries *dplyr*, *fclust*, *mnormt*, *ICGE*, *splitTools* if not already present in your R installation.

```bash

```

```bash
Rscript example2.R
```
 
## Docker container for reproducibility

A docker container for testing reproducibility of the results presented in the paper is hosted in DockerHub.

To download it:

```bash
docker pull jmartinezot/fc-df
```

You could add a more convenient image tag:

```bash
docker tag jmartinezot/fc-df:latest fc-df:latest
```

To run it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix fc-df /bin/bash -c 'cat /fc-df.readme.txt; cd /fc-df; bash'
```

The container shows a README file at the start, with instructions to run the code:

```bash

This is the docker container associated to the https://github.com/rsait/FC-DF repository, and provided for replicability of the results presented in the paper *Fuzzy classification with distance-based depth prototypes: High-dimensional Unsupervised and/or Supervised problems*.

To obtain the results presented in the paper, please just execute the following commands:

Rscript AlizadehReproducibility.R
Rscript ClevelandReproducibility.R

The examples of the repository can also be executed:

Rscript example1.R
Rscript example2.R
```
