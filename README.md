# Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function

 This repository contains the R code to apply the Fuzzy Classification based on Depth Function (FC-DF) algorithm. In addition, public data sets used in the work  *Fuzzy classification with distance-based depth prototypes: High-dimensional Unsupervised and/or Supervised problems* are included. 

The source of the public data set are:
